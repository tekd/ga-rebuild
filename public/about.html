            <h3>Whether taken in person or online, the GovLab Academy’s courses, clinics, coaching programs, and workshops offer a flipped learning experience. There are no experts at the front of the room or the top of the screen delivering packaged content to passive learners.</h3>

        <p>The goal of the GovLab Academy is to train public problem solvers – what we call public entrepreneurs – to use technology to create implementable engagement projects with the ultimate objective of improving people’s lives.</p>
        <p>We do not measure success by levels of enrollment but by the impact participant projects create.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, you are at the center of everything we do – a public entrepreneur working on real projects in real communities. Around you we organize the relevant materials, mentor and coaching networks, training exercises, and practice sessions. For you we curate readings and videos, gather examples of best practice, design process interventions, provide critiques and advice, and make introductions to experts.</p>
        <p>Over the last three years, in a series of Masters-level academic courses and online and off-line workshops and coaching programs, the GovLab and its network of 25 world-class instructors and coaches and over 100 mentors have trained 446 participants in more than a dozen US cities and thirty foreign countries to take a public interest technology project from idea to implementation. <a href="#">FOR MORE ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED</a></p>

        <p>Badges can be displayed as a credential by incorporating into a resume or website. GovLab Academy will maintain a registry of all badge recipients.

                  <p>Francois Grey is a physicist by training, with a background in nanotechnology and a passion for citizen science. Since September 2014, he is Invited Professor at the University of Geneva and Manager of the Citizen Cyberscience Centre, a partnership between CERN, the United Nations Institute of Training and Research and the University of Geneva. 
<br/>
The CCC develops technologies that lower the barrier to entry for online participatory science and promotes the use of these technologies in developing regions through face-to-face meetups between scientists, developers and citizens. The CCC has helped to launch citizen science projects such as CERN’s Test4Theory, which is part of the LHC@home volunteer computing initiative, and open source platforms for citizen science like Crowdcrafting.org, for volunteer thinking. Events launched by the CCC include the Africa@Home, Asia@home and Brasil@home workshops series, the CERN Webfest and the biannual Citizen Cyberscience Summit. 
<br/>
From 2013-2014 Francois was Head of Citizen Science at NYU’s Center for Urban Science and Progress, where he launched the Science and the City hackathons in collaboration with ITP, NYU’s Interactive Telecommunications Program and Science Hack Day NYC in collaboration with the World Science Festival. 
<br/>
Francois was based in Beijing from 2008-2013, where he helped establish the Open Wisdom Lab at Tsinghua University, China’s MIT, to promote concepts of open and participatory science. He also helped establish Tsinghua’s Lifelong Learning Lab, which extends concepts of participatory science to children of all ages. He has also been a visiting Senior International Expert with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, where he initiated online citizen science in China through a project called CAS@home. Francois received a prestigious Fellowship from the South-Africa-based Shuttleworth Foundation in 2010-11, for his efforts to promote citizen science in the developing world.

                  <p>Clay Johnson is an American technologist, co-founder and Chairman of the Department of Better Technology and best known for his role in supporting political campaigns and government agencies with technology services. He was one of the founders of Blue State Digital, the firm that built and managed Barack Obama’s online campaign for the presidency in 2008. After leaving Blue State, Johnson was the director of Sunlight Labs at the Sunlight Foundation, where he built an army of 2000 developers and designers to build open source tools to give people greater access to government data. He was awarded the Google/O’Reilly Open Source Organizer of the year in 2009, was one of Federal Computing Week’s Fed 100 in 2010, and won the CampaignTech Innovator award in 2011. Johnson’s combination of experience as a developer, working in politics, entrepreneurism, and non-profit work gives him a unique perspective on media and culture. His life is dedicated to giving people greater access to the truth about what’s going on in their communities, their cities and their governments. He still claims that he learned all he needs to know from a two year tour as the late-shift waiter at Waffle House in Atlanta, GA.</p>

                  <p>Liz is an activist and designer interested in collaborative urban environments. My early days in New York involved catalyzing public interactions on sidewalks and subway stations with a giant "Talk To Me" sign as well as working 25 floors above Wall Street (SOM) designing international new cities and campuses. I'm originally from North Carolina where I managed an urban agriculture youth enterprise called the Durham Inner-city Gardeners (DIG). Currently, when I'm not hoisting cameras up on balloons (with Public Laboratory) or hugging trees with tape measures (with TreeKIT), I teach geospatial tools for urban design at Columbia, Parsons, and Pratt.

<p>Start Date: April 6, 2015 Week Start: April 6 - 10 End : May 29, 2015 Application: March 13, 2015</p>
<p>Passion: [object Object]</p>
<p>Bullets: Seeking to start a social or public “lab” within a public sector institution or working on pressing public interest problems?,Do you already work in a Public Lab but want to expand your work to include new approaches or new domains?,Seeking to learn more about how to apply experimental methods to address social and public challenges?</p> <!-- Loop through -->
<p>Desc Short: Drawing on growing worldwide experience with technology-enabled innovation labs at different levels of government, this coaching program is designed to help those starting or running such labs learn from the experience of others</p>
<p>Desc Long: Although there is no one shared definition of what constitutes a social or public lab, the “lab approach” might be expected to include experimentation in a safe space at one remove from everyday reality, with the goal of generating useful ideas that address social needs and demonstrating their effectiveness in practice There are several hundred ‘living labs’, mainly technology based, and enabling some user input to shaping technologies. More recently, labs of various kinds have spread into governments, some using design methods to better understand needs and opportunities, some focused on data, or using challenges to elicit ideas.

<h3>Course Name: Citizen Science on the Web</h3>
<p>Duration: 8 weeks</p>
<p>Start Date: March 2, 2015 Week Start: March 2 - 6 End : April 25, 2015 Application:  February 25, 2015</p>
<p>Passion: [object Object]</p>
<p>Bullets: Are you interested in tackling a scientific or environmental problem by engaging a wider public in tasks such as data gathering, measurement or other activities to aid in the execution of a science project?,Do you need to know how to target specific kinds of participants with the right know how?,Do you view citizens as scientists in their own right and want to support more people “doing science,” whether for educational or public policy purposes, in their own communities?,Is your citizen science project underway but needs to scale and attract more participants? Create more effective metrics?</p> <!-- Loop through -->
<p>Desc Short: Time and again, citizen scientist -amateurs, enthusiasts, aficionados- have clearly shown they can make great contributions to public science projects. This coaching program is focused on the task of designing such projects in ways that best allow them to do so.</p>
<p>Desc Long: The notion that ordinary citizens with a strong interest in science – call them amateurs, enthusiasts, aficionados or even cheerleaders – can participate actively in cutting-edge science via the Web is no longer controversial. Galaxy Zoo (cataloguing galaxy images) and Foldit (folding proteins) are poster children for the citizen cyberscience movement. Perhaps even more intriguing are a number of smaller, less well-known projects like PrimeGrid (searching for new prime numbers) and Herbaria@home (digitizing archived historical plant clippings), where an amateur created a project, which is producing data professional scientists want to get their hands on. The right participant in this program knows civic problem they are trying to solve through the application of citizen science and has a citizen science project already in mind, if not already underway. Through peer to peer coaching and mentoring, the objective of this program is to help and encourage participants to develop more effective, scalable, and impactful citizen science projects. A particular preference for projects involving data collection and analysis, using the Web and mobile technologies.</p>

<h3>Course Name: Tech Procurement Projects: Making the Supply Chain Work</h3>
<p>Duration: 4 weeks</p>
<p>Start Date: March 16, 2015 Week Start: March 16 - 20 End : April 10, 2015 Application: March 6, 2015</p>
<p>Passion: [object Object]</p>
<p>Bullets: Are you working to simplify the policy or regulations relating to procurement?,Do you have a project aimed at making procurement more transparent? Efficient? Accountable?,Are you eager to develop strategies for procuring more innovative and effective solutions from more diverse bidders?</p> <!-- Loop through -->
<p>Desc Short: Most government procurement processes are, at best, burdensome and, more likely, broken. They are neither efficient nor inclusive, neither fully clean nor accountable. This coaching program is focused on supporting projects dedicated to changing that.</p>
<p>Desc Long: The way government purchases, especially information technology, is profoundly broken. Government should not be spending as much to make a website as it invests in scientific research to map the human brain. When the open government community talks about “Fixing Procurement” what we’re really talking about is making it so that the contracts don’t keep getting awarded to the same giant IT enterprise integrators over and over again. This group is designed for those focusing on all stages and types of contracting reform, bureaucracy and regulatory navigation at all levels of government, including projects to: simplify the RFP process; attract more minority and women-owned businesses; enable more open review and decision-making processes; encourage the procurement of innovative not only cheap solutions; decrease corruption and improve accountability, publish open contracting data or make sense of it. If you are engaged in an effort to bring greater sanity to the procurement process -- especially technology procurement -- come join us! The ideal candidate is someone who knows the problem they are trying to solve and who has a project in mind.</p>

<h3>Course Name: Leveraging Crowds in the Public Sector</h3>
<p>Duration: 4 weeks</p>
<p>Start Date: March 23, 2015 Week Start: March 23 - 27, 2015 End : April 17, 2015 Application: March 20, 2015</p>
<p>Passion: [object Object]</p>
<p>Bullets: Trying to solve a public public and want to assess the appropriateness of crowdsourcing?,Using crowdsourcing and engagement to enhance policy-making or service delivery ?,Seeking to integrate crowdsourcing into organizational and institutional operations on an ongoing basis?,Implementing a citizen engagement project through crowdsourcing and need support to assess impact or scale it?</p> <!-- Loop through -->
<p>Desc Short: Understanding what kinds of problems a crowd really can handle better and how to manage the process requires careful design. However, after a decade of study, we have identified when crowds tend to outperform internal organizations (or not).</p>
<p>Desc Long: More and more organizations are turning to crowds for help in solving their most vexing innovation and research questions. But managers remain understandably cautious. It seems risky and even unnatural to push problems out to vast groups of strangers distributed around the world, particularly for organizations and institutions built on a history of internal innovation. Understanding what kinds of problems a crowd really can handle better and how to manage the process requires careful design. However, after a decade of study, we have identified when crowds tend to outperform internal organizations (or not). This program is designed to help those wishing to integrate crowdsourcing into ongoing projects. Whether policymaking or service delivery in nature, we start from the assumption that, engaging citizens is generally both more effective and more legitimate as a way of working. Together we will explore how to better harness crowdsourcing and distributed innovation networks by offering guidance on choosing the best form of crowdsourcing for a given situation. Applicants should have a clear view of the problem they are trying to solve and either an ongoing or an about-to-start crowdsourcing project. Although everyone is invited to apply, there will be an admissions preference for those working at the city-level.</p>

<h3>Course Name: Open Data Projects</h3>
<p>Duration: 4 weeks</p>
<p>Start Date: June 9, 2015 2015 Week Start: June 8 - 12, 2015 End : June 30, 2015 Application: June 5, 2015, 2015</p>
<p>Passion: [object Object]</p>
<p>Bullets: Do you want to leverage the growing availability of freely available government data to make mission-critical decisions?,Do you have a strong interest in being more strategic in fulfilling your mission but are missing the skills to  identifying data sets, finding patterns, and making predictions?</p> <!-- Loop through -->
<p>Desc Short: Open data refers to the growing practice of making government data freely available, easily machine processable and without any restrictions on reuse. This course is designed for individuals and small organizations (including SMEs) eager to develop open data data-driven decisions.</p>
<p>Desc Long: Open data refers to the growing practice of making government data freely available, easily machine processable and without any restrictions on reuse.  As such, open data can be a democratizing force for organizations that traditionally have less access to mission-critical information such as Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) or Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs). Leveraging open data can enable organizations to make more well-informed decisions. This course is designed for individuals and organizations (including SMEs) eager to develop open data-driven decisions.

<p>Desc Short: This group is designed for those with projects focusing on fully realize the promise of open contracting on all stages and contract types, from more basic contracts for the procurement of goods, to complex contracts, joint venture agreements, licenses and production sharing agreements.</p>
<p>Desc Long: Contracts are fundamental to how governments generate and spend. Contracts are at the nexus of revenue generation, budget planning, resource management and delivery of public goods. Contracts are at the core of how countries operate. Governments around the world spend an estimated US $9.5 trillion every single year through contracts. Yet, contracting information is often unavailable for public scrutiny. Adding to the problems stemming from lack of transparency, the resources spent through these contracts are often poorly managed or misappropriated. When companies, governments and citizens continue to get hit by ineffective and unfair contracting practices, theft and waste, everyone is paying the price. Ultimately, contracting that is not open undermines development for all. Open contracting refers to norms and practices for increased disclosure and participation in public contracting including tendering, performance and completion and it encompasses all public contracting, including contracts funded by combinations of public, private and donor sources. This group is designed for those with projects focusing on fully realize the promise of open contracting on all stages and contract types, from more basic contracts for the procurement of goods, to complex contracts, joint venture agreements, licenses and production sharing agreements.</p>

<p>Bullets: Are you working in the private sector and curious to learn more about how your company’s data might be used to drive social change?,Are you working for a company that is looking to broaden its corporate social responsibility efforts in innovative ways?,Is your company considering sharing certain data assets but worried about the potential risks?,Do you have a strong interest in being more strategic in fulfilling your mission but are missing the skills to  identifying data sets, finding patterns, and making predictions?</p> <!-- Loop through -->
<p>Desc Short: Coaching program designed for private sector companies interested in sharing data for public good, together we explore your datasets’ potential to promote social good; understand different governance models for sharing; and evaluate risks and strategies to mitigate them to achieve the highest social impact responsibly.</p>
<p>Desc Long: Over the past years, corporate efforts in which private data is shared with research teams have shown the potential that private sector data holds to drive social change. This program is designed for those seeking for insights about corporate data sharing to private sector participants. Through it we will explore your datasets potential to promote social good; what risks might occur when their corporate datasets are shared, and how to mitigate those risks; and, the different models for sharing (shades of open, different data governance models, etc). The term ‘Data Collaborative’ was coined by the NYU GovLab, to describe a new kind of corporate data sharing effort, where data is not blind-sightedly opened to the public, but rather shared with specific parties in a controlled environment. Corporations engaging in a Data Collaborative keep a certain amount of control over the data they make available to, for example, research teams. This practice offers a safe way of providing the research community with oftentimes highly valuable data, whilst mitigating the risks involved. In particular, this course will cover the following subjects: a) develop an understanding of what corporate data sharing is and why corporations engage in it; b) learn what current corporate data sharing efforts look like (through i.a. the GovLab Data Collaboratives Directory), which types of corporate data sets are currently being shared, and who are using them; c) learn from others through understanding how research teams are using corporate data sets to create solutions, and to optimize their operations, through in-depth case studies and analyses; d) provide strategies for small organization to define a strategy for sharing some of their data assets, take stock of in-house data resources available to them, and experiment with data sharing in a safe space; and e) Understand the challenges and best practices of corporate data sharing.</p>

<p>Desc Short: Coaching program geared towards both government officials and policymakers exploring how bottom-up sensor projects can achieve a core mission and technical experts exploring how to get their project implemented.</p>
<p>Desc Long: Cheap sensors are creating new sources of data generated directly by the people. From monitoring air and water quality to noise levels, environmental conditions, to also monitoring personal behavior such as distance walked or biked, monitoring devices and sensors can help us generate and collect data about factors relevant to both individuals as well as communities. Geared towards government officials, policymakers wanting to understand how bottom-up sensor projects can achieve a core mission or tech experts wanting to know hot to get their project implemented, this course will facilitate and guide the discussion related to the design, creation and implementation of a strategy to measure activity of sensors of any kind, that can feed data into a open database to be used by anyone. Power of data typically comes from volume and access. The more people who can access more data, the more are the chances for innovative reuse. The cost of gathering data is reduced and its utility increased with every reuse. Unencumbered online access, especially through APIs, is the way to ensure that everyone benefits from individual action leading to more opportunities for us to improve our lives.</p>

<p>Bullets: Are you working on a project to streamline the delivery of government or nonprofit benefits to citizens?,Are you seeking to use technology to aid citizens in discovering the benefits for which they are eligible? In accessing, renewing or delivering those benefits?,Are you trying to help government or other organizations better determine who is eligible for which services in order to increase efficiency and fairness?,Are you working on a project where you want to learn more about how to use technology and open source tools to make work on benefits more effective and have greater impact?,Do you want to learn from peers and experts about what works?</p> <!-- Loop through -->
<p>Desc Short: Led by New York City Council member Ben Kallos, this program is designed to convene government, social and civic entrepreneurs who are developing projects around the automation and delivery of benefits and services for citizens.</p>
<p>Desc Long: &lt;p&gt;For many low-income citizens, getting access to benefits for which they are already eligible requires them to negotiate a minefield of forms, websites and duplicate documentation. Technology can improve government and organizational efficiency and ensure that thousands of citizens don’t lose out on benefits simply by enabling the automation of enrollment and renewal of people into the system. Recertifications can be automatic rather than arduous, eliminating repetitive paperwork and allowing people to get what they need and the government to reduce administrative costs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Innovations in Automatic Benefits for Citizens is a ten week online coaching program designed to convene government, social and civic entrepreneurs (both individuals and teams) who are developing projects around the automation and delivery of benefits and services for citizens. With expert guidance from Councilmember Ben Kallos, Chair of the Committee on Governmental Operations of the New York City Council, we will help you to understand the operational flow of government as well as how to start building free and open source tools and/or bridge them with resources like OpenFisca and CiviCRM.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether your project is nonprofit or for-profit, this program aims, through peer-to-peer support and expert coaching and mentoring, to help innovators design, implement, scale, and assess effective projects.&lt;/p&gt;

<h2>CLINICS</h2>

<h3>Transforming SMEs Through Open Data Innovation</h3>
<p>Designed to help the leaders of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) use open and shared data to solve business problems, design new product and service offerings, and drive innovation within their business models. The Clinic will take SME entrepreneurs through every step of the process of finding, accessing, cleaning, structuring, and deploying open data.</p>

<h3>Solving Public Problems with Technology</h3>
<p>A 14 week program – delivered jointly with the Polytechnic School of Engineering at NYU, the School of Professional Services at NYU, the Media Lab at MIT, Arizona State University, Yale Law School, and Stanford Design School – that leads individuals and teams through all stages of an agile, design-driven, innovation-focused project development process. Non-credit, online participation is also possible for individuals and teams working on innovation projects in active public service</p>

<h3>Sustainable Governance Innovation</h3>
<p>Addressing the challenges involved in creating a robust capability within government to imagine, design, and implement a flow of significant innovations over time</p>

<h3>Decision Analysis and Risk Management</h3>
<p>The aim of the course is to expose participants to the fundamentals of decision analysis, the connections between assessments and societal decision making, and the role of decision making in a pragmatic context of improving outcomes. Participants will learn to apply the scientific method and falsification in the context of an assessment, and know how to build an open assessment based on the requirements of societal decision making. The focus is on how to convincingly exclude poor decision options rather than trying to find a theoretically optimal solution (e.g. with highest expected utility).
</p>

<h3>Engaging citizens: a game-changer for development</h3>
<p>Governments are more effective when they work with citizens to solve problems  and development challenges. For this reason, the World Bank, in partnership with the London School of Economics, The Overseas Development Institute,  Participedia, and CIVICUS, has developed a free 4-week course on Citizen  Engagement, hosted by Coursera. &lt;br/&gt; The course provides a holistic overview of citizen engagement through  interactive videos, resources, and activities and is taught by a number of the foremost experts in the field, including John Gaventa (IDS, Coady Institute), Rakesh Rajani (Ford Foundation), Danny Sriskandarajah (CIVICUS), Jonathan  Fox (American University), and Beth Simone Noveck (The Governance Lab).  It examines the role citizen engagement can play in improving policymaking  and pubic service delivery, and investigates the impact of new technologies, particularly in developing countries. Participants can contribute their own
 insights and connect with others through online forums, dedicated social
 media channels, and Google hangouts.

<h2>CLINICS</h2>

<h3>Transforming SMEs Through Open Data Innovation</h3>
<p>Designed to help the leaders of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) use open and shared data to solve business problems, design new product and service offerings, and drive innovation within their business models. The Clinic will take SME entrepreneurs through every step of the process of finding, accessing, cleaning, structuring, and deploying open data.</p>

<h3>Solving Public Problems with Technology</h3>
<p>A 14 week program – delivered jointly with the Polytechnic School of Engineering at NYU, the School of Professional Services at NYU, the Media Lab at MIT, Arizona State University, Yale Law School, and Stanford Design School – that leads individuals and teams through all stages of an agile, design-driven, innovation-focused project development process. Non-credit, online participation is also possible for individuals and teams working on innovation projects in active public service</p>

<h3>Sustainable Governance Innovation</h3>
<p>Addressing the challenges involved in creating a robust capability within government to imagine, design, and implement a flow of significant innovations over time</p>

<h3>Decision Analysis and Risk Management</h3>
<p>The aim of the course is to expose participants to the fundamentals of decision analysis, the connections between assessments and societal decision making, and the role of decision making in a pragmatic context of improving outcomes. Participants will learn to apply the scientific method and falsification in the context of an assessment, and know how to build an open assessment based on the requirements of societal decision making. The focus is on how to convincingly exclude poor decision options rather than trying to find a theoretically optimal solution (e.g. with highest expected utility).
</p>

<h3>Engaging citizens: a game-changer for development</h3>
<p>Governments are more effective when they work with citizens to solve problems  and development challenges. For this reason, the World Bank, in partnership with the London School of Economics, The Overseas Development Institute,  Participedia, and CIVICUS, has developed a free 4-week course on Citizen  Engagement, hosted by Coursera. &lt;br/&gt; The course provides a holistic overview of citizen engagement through  interactive videos, resources, and activities and is taught by a number of the foremost experts in the field, including John Gaventa (IDS, Coady Institute), Rakesh Rajani (Ford Foundation), Danny Sriskandarajah (CIVICUS), Jonathan  Fox (American University), and Beth Simone Noveck (The Governance Lab).  It examines the role citizen engagement can play in improving policymaking  and pubic service delivery, and investigates the impact of new technologies, particularly in developing countries. Participants can contribute their own
 insights and connect with others through online forums, dedicated social
 media channels, and Google hangouts.

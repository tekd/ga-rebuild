        <p><strong>Description:</strong>  In this paper, the authors argue that a more systematic ontology for data visualization to ensure the successful communication of meaning. &quot;Visualization begins when someone has data that they wish to explore and interpret; the data are encoded as input to a visualization system, which may in its turn interact with other systems to produce a representation. This is communicated back to the user(s), who have to assess this against their goals and knowledge, possibly leading to further cycles of activity. Each phase of this process involves communication between two parties. For this to succeed, those parties must share a common language with an agreed meaning.</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong>  This paper from the Research Area of the Bank of Italy&#39;s Law and Economics Department &quot;surveys the literature on product use information and analyzes whether and to what extent Italian regulator is trying to ensure consumers’ awareness as to their use pattern.&quot; Rather than focusing on the type of information governments can release to citizens, Brodi proposes that governments require private companies to provide valuable use pattern information to citizens to inform decision-making.

        <p><strong>Description:</strong>  In this paper, Cavoukian describes the Personal Data Ecosystem (PDE), an &quot;emerging landscape of companies and organizations that believe individuals should be in control of their personal data, and make available a growing number of tools and technologies to enable this control.&quot; She argues that, &quot;The right to privacy is highly compatible with the notion of PDE because it enables the individual to have a much greater degree of control -- &quot;Radical Control&quot; -- over their personal information than is currently possible today.&quot; </p>

A coherent framework would be based on a risk matrix, taking into account the value of different uses of data against the potential risks to individual autonomy and privacy.  </p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> This law review article introduces the idea of crowdsourcing expertise to mitigate the challenge of patent processing. Noveck argues that, &quot;access to information is the crux of the patent quality problem. Patent examiners currently make decisions about the grant of a patent that will shape an industry for a twenty-year period on the basis of a limited subset of available information. Examiners may neither consult the public, talk to experts, nor, in many cases, even use the Internet.</p>

In a time of plummeting budgets and efficiency drives, those in power have realised they needn&#39;t always rely on slow-moving, expensive outsourcing and development to improve public services. Instead, they can consider running a hackathon, at which tech-savvy members of the public come together to create apps and other digital tools that promise to enhance the provision of healthcare, schools or policing.&quot; </p>

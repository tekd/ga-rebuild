        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Whether taken in person or online, the GovLab Academy’s courses, clinics, coaching programs, and workshops offer a flipped learning experience. There are no experts at the front of the room or the top of the screen delivering packaged content to passive learners.</p>

        <p>You are at the center of everything we do – a civic entrepreneur working on real projects in real communities. Around you we organize the relevant materials, mentor and coaching networks, training exercises, and practice sessions. For you we curate readings and videos, gather examples of best practice, design process interventions, provide critiques and advice, and make introductions to experts.</p>
        <p>Generously funded by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, we do not define our goal – our mission – as efficiently passing along textbook wisdom. We define it as empowering ever-wider cohorts of people like you through the messy, rugged experience of developing real-world projects. We do not measure our success by levels of enrollment. We measure it by the credible aspirations of those we touch and the reach and impact of the projects they create and lead.</p>

        <p>Non-credit online participants who complete the program receive an authenticated Certificate and Badge. Badges are open, portable and "stackable" with other badges. </p>
        <p>Badges can be displayed as a credential by incorporating into a resume or website. GovLab Academy will maintain a registry of all badge recipients. For successful participants the program could serve as a gateway to opportunities to compete for a range of Fellowship and funding opportunities, including from the Knight Foundation, the D-Prize, GovLab and more.</p>

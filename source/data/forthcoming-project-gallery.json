    "description": "Sparked by a conversation at the Department of Justice Canada’s 2014 Policy Bazaar, the Policy Sector recently launched the Indigenous Policy and Program Innovation (IPPI) Hub, an 18-month pilot that will explore how new policy techniques, such as design thinking, can be used to address the over-representation of Indigenous people in the criminal justice system. Similar to other labs in the federal government, the IPPI Hub brings together various stakeholders to collect and share information, test new approaches, conduct analysis and co-create options and solutions directly with the users or citizens affected by a policy issue. In addition to applying innovative approaches to Indigenous justice-related policy and program development, the Hub’s mandate also includes raising awareness of new policy development techniques. The IPPI Hub believes that innovation shouldn’t happen in silos nor should innovation be the responsibility of one official or group. The IPPI Hub believes that innovation shouldn’t happen in silos nor should innovation be the responsibility of one official or group. The IPPI Hub envisions Justice Canada as a department where officials at all levels, regardless of their job title, are equipped with the knowledge to use innovative tools in all areas of their work (where possible).",

People will be able to use a mobile app to ‘catch them doing something good’ - such as recycling, or saving energy. This way, we’ll create a large crowd-sourced database of responsible companies. We’ll start by targeting small towns in concerted campaigns to create competition between companies. This way we’ll quickly reach tipping points where they begin to ‘race to the top’.

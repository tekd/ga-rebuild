She moved to New York City since 2012 to study the MPA in Public and Nonprofit Management and Policy at NYU Robert F.

Now she believes the best advocacy agenda for every human right must involve and leverage the new communication and information technologies. As a fellow at the GovLab she will be researching and testing how experts systems can be used as a tool to better share knowledge and expertise. Ultimately, she hopes to explore and re-imagine our present, forming new communities and organizational structures guided by the principles of empathy and collaboration.Before she moved here, she was the founder and director of the Human Rights Center of the Facultad Libre de Derecho de Monterrey and volunteered for pro bono legal services. In her free time she is developing an online platform that will nurture a collaborative network of legal practitioners, activists and stakeholders.The platform will be intended to crowdsource legal arguments, infographics and visual media, a social media campaign and plaintiffs.

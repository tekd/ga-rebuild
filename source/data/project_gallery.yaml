  short_title: "Beacon"
  sectors: not-for-profit # not-for-profit || public-sector || academia || entrepreneur
  location: "Montecristi, Dominican Republic & Mwanza, Tanzania"
  tagline: "911 Where There is None"
  background: "There are an estimated 4.5 billion mobile phone users across the globe, yet approximately 80% of the world’s population has no reliable way to call for help in the event of a life-threatening illness or injury. Nonetheless, lack of access to basic emergency health care services is a major contributor to health disparities between developed and developing nations with low- and middle-income countries having substantially higher mortality rates for what would otherwise be considered preventable deaths."
  description: "BEACON is a text message-based emergency medical dispatching software created by Trek Medics International, and designed specifically for communities where consistent ambulance response is not available. By relaying text messages from the scene of an emergency to trained responders throughout the community, the software enables the nearest available emergency care providers to quickly locate, treat and transport emergency victims to local hospitals."
  impact: "Our goal is to ensure that 90% of victims requesting emergency assistance through the communities we work will be attended to by trained layperson responders with access to transport within 10 minutes in urban centers and within 30 minutes in peripheral communities. We believe that the minimal human, physical and financial resources associated with a text message-based emergency medical dispatch system will make the implementation of prehospital care systems possible wherever mobile phones are used, providing a sustainable and cost-effective model for other low-resource settings."

  location: "New York, NY"
  tagline: "Helping People Obtain, Understand & Use Environmental Information"
  background: "The U.S. lacks an efficient process for disseminating environmental information. People need information to make environmental decisions. The public is left depending on corporations and government entities to make environmental decisions for them. U.S. citizens rely on a combination of FOIA and some environmental law provisions to obtain environmental information which is problematic because information is hard to find and understand, FOIA exemptions block access and create delays, and agencies use outdated technology. The U.S. part of the Rio Convention, which requires parties to give people access to environmental information, but U.S. currently fails to do so effectively."
  description:  "Right now, environmental information is hard to get, and even harder to understand and use. Green Archives will be a well-established source for environmental information. It will also go beyond basic information access, connecting people with individuals and organizations that can help them ¨translate” the complex jargon of environmental information and link them to others interested in environmental advocacy and action related to the information they seek. Through environmental information access and online connection opportunities, Green Archives will connect localized communities with wider networks that may help facilitate legislative, judicial, or regulatory community work to face the environmental issue at hand."
  impact: "This project helps information seekers to obtain and decode environmental information as both a functional tool and a vision of what government information access in the U.S. could be by providing environmental information gathered from proactive FOIA disclosures and FOIA request responses from federal agencies, and creating a space for experts to assist information seekers in understanding the information contained in the FOIA records. Finally, environmental advocates can use the space to find others sharing interests in the same environmental issues."

#   description:  "Sparked by a conversation at the Department of Justice Canada’s 2014 Policy Bazaar, the Policy Sector recently launched the Indigenous Policy and Program Innovation (IPPI) Hub, an 18-month pilot that will explore how new policy techniques, such as design thinking, can be used to address the over-representation of Indigenous people in the criminal justice system. Similar to other labs in the federal government, the IPPI Hub brings together various stakeholders to collect and share information, test new approaches, conduct analysis and co-create options and solutions directly with the users or citizens affected by a policy issue. In addition to applying innovative approaches to Indigenous justice-related policy and program development, the Hub’s mandate also includes raising awareness of new policy development techniques. The IPPI Hub believes that innovation shouldn’t happen in silos nor should innovation be the responsibility of one official or group. The IPPI Hub believes that innovation shouldn’t happen in silos nor should innovation be the responsibility of one official or group. The IPPI Hub envisions Justice Canada as a department where officials at all levels, regardless of their job title, are equipped with the knowledge to use innovative tools in all areas of their work (where possible)."

  impact: "The expected impact of innovating in the public sector is uncertain. However, it is practically undeniable that life has greatly changed in the last two decades (mainly due to technology), yet government structures have remained virtually the same for the past 200 years. The impact of reinventing governance and adapting it to current times is thus expected to be immense."

Since 2006, PPF has built free, libre and open-source technology for open government and public accountability. In 2007, PPF’s flagship OpenCongress launched, and over the next eight years grew to become the most-visited non-profit site for tracking the U.S. Congress. PPF brought the OpenCongress model to state legislatures with OpenGovernment.org in 2011, and continual online conversation with the question-and-answers platform AskThem.io in 2014. Now, PPF’s primary project is Councilmatic.org, for city-level open government, with the Chicago-based civic tech company DataMade as tech leads. Councilmatic was created by Mjumbe Poe as a Code For America Fellow in Philadelphia in 2011 as an open-source web app. In 2015, PPF and DataMade re-factored the Councilmatic open-source code to integrate with the Open Civic Data standard, making it easier to set up open-data versions of Councilmatic in more cities."

  impact: |
    Councilmatic is currently up in three cities: Chicago, New York City, and Philadelphia. Councilmatic is an independent public resource, displaying information in the Open Civic Data open standard. The project has unique areas of impact, as follows: 
    <ul class="project-list">
    <li>First, it creates new open data on everything in city councils: elected officials, committees, public events, and every single legislative item - all the bills in city councils - with every action and full text and more.</li> 
    <li>A fast, user-focused, mobile-responsive web app </li>
    <li>Advanced search features to filter keyword searches by type of legislation, sponsor, or more </li>
    <li>Tracking features to follow legislative actions over RSS - and coming soon, email and SMS and social media </li>
    <li>Public comment forums (optional) on legislative items, for online discussion of local issues </li>
    <li>SMS outreach (optional) for wider public discussion of community priorities </li>
    <li>“How local government works” help context and legislative process explainers </li>
    <li>Address lookup of local elected officials </li>
    <li>Maps of geographic locations mentioned in bill text</li>
    <li>Open-data calendar list of upcoming events, such as committee hearings or council meetings</li>
    <li>In Chicago, advanced categorization of bills by sub-topic using data analysis of bill text language</li>
    <li>Filtering options to see not just what bills are introduced or recently active, but which were left in committee - a meaningful, unique view on introduced legislation that hasn’t advanced past committee stages. Useful for journalists and researchers. </li>
    <li>Forthcoming, free embeddable HTML & Javascript widgets for city elected officials, committees and any legislative item, for digital media companies</li>
    <li>In NYC, a free, volunteer public dialogue program with “verified” council offices - monthly discussions with participating council office staff, to respond online to public comments. This program is designed, at about one staff per month, to close the feedback loop of civic engagement locally and encourage constituents to post their comments on Councilmatic in order to share the response with their community.</li>

The lack of IT capabilities and constrained resources of government agencies make it difficult for them to respond to the demands of information from their constituencies, transparency advocates, the press and central governments. Moreover, these administrations don’t usually have access to analysis tools that help them view how the resources are being used and to detect potential risks of misspending. SpendView is a platform for analysis and visualization of government budget, expenditure and revenue data."
  impact: "We are currently working with other municipal, provincial and federal in Latin America, helping them to adopt SpendView for internal use, or as a tool for fiscal transparency. Using open data, we built instances of Presupuesto Abierto/Spend View for the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina (http://caba.presupuestoabierto.org) and Montevideo, Uruguay (http://montevideo.presupuestoabierto.org)"

  sectors: "public-sector" #not-for-profit || public-sector || academia || entrepreneur
  short_title: "Democratic Regeneration Through Technology"
  location: "Madrid, Spain"
  tagline: "Turning Grassroots Activism into Participatory, Accountable Governance"
  background: "Since 2008, Europe has faced its deepest economic and political crisis since Second World War. In this context, new social movements and political parties are emerging, particularly in Southern European democracies. Podemos, a new Spanish political party born from grassroots activism and protests (Indignados Movement), is trying to reinvigorate public institutions that have lost the trust of the public introducing massive online direct democracy participation mechanisms where Spanish citizens can deliberate, make and vote proposals, ask questions of Podemos leaders, and even propose and built projects for which to use party money. The citizen’s response to this political initiative is being overwhelming."
  description: "This project seeks to analyze how digital tools can be used to implement a more direct and participatory democracy. We will be thinking about what makes a digital participation process fair and effective, when can digital participation be used to make binding decisions, when is it better used to seek input, and how can its use be improved. To accomplish that, we will discuss the structure and functioning of Podemos' participation tools to promote crowdsourcing, crowdvoting and crowdfunding initiatives, the thinking behind each of them, and the strengths and weaknesses of each platform. We will then present 'best practices' based on these observations."
  impact: "Using Podemos as a case study, this project is theoretically and socially relevant because it aims to analyze how new technologies can better serve to democratic regeneration and propose recommendations to help other political parties around the world, and across the spectrum, that want to experiment using technology to become more democratic. In other words, our hope is that learning from this unique contemporary experience of direct democracy, we can help other political parties build on what Podemos has done. It is important to highlight that these lessons can be also useful for other public and private institutions (profit and non-profit) interacting with citizens to provide services of general interest."

  background: "When disaster strikes, communication and power infrastructures are lost for days or even weeks at a time. During this time, communications remain critical in informing decisions on resource allocation, medical attention, and financial aid. To this end, LDLN provides off-the-grid, decentralized communications networks for disaster relief agencies and medical professionals deployed to the field. Even without a power grid, cell signal, or Internet, relief agents enter rich field data into our mobile apps that auto-synchronize with LDLN Base Station for quick, accurate reporting at headquarters."
  description:  "We provide the framework & technology for organizations and individuals to instantly communicate rich data without the need for Internet, cell service, satellites or phone lines."
  impact: "While LDLN tech is designed from the ground up around the most severe situation (no external power or data services), having any of these available strengthen the power of our network and syncing algorithms. For instance, our Base Stations can connect to the Internet via Ethernet, or to a generator or car battery via MicroUSB adapter. Additionally, we see opportunity to take our network technology beyond the scope of disaster relief, including: private communication networks for corporations, digital educational curricula distribution, and as a reliable grid for hospitals and medical centers."

  tagline: "Uniting Journalists and Citizens to Create Public-Oriented News Reports on Public Issues"
  background: "The project started as a collaboration between two OEA fellows in Open government. Open Journalism connects the tools and techniques of crowdsourcing to news making practices. Instead of opening governments, we are open news media outlets to include citizens to make the news."
  description:  "Our project makes use of crowdsourcing tools to unite journalists and citizens in making the news. We use the participative culture of the web to aid journalists to seek help of citizens in reporting public issues, and to aid motivated citizens to engage in the news agenda. We capacitative, challenge and motivate journalists, citizens and hackers to work together, constructively, in news making processes."
  impact: "News industries are shrinking. Social media is booming. When we create participatory ways to not only consume, but to make the news, we can recreate how news industries are funded, and we can also highlight their role as watchdog, civic institutions. More news made based on open journalism culture means more citizens connected to the news, stronger civil society institutions, and new journalistic posts."

  sectors: not-for-profit # not-for-profit || public-sector || academia || entrepreneur
  location: "Global online audience. Based in New York, NY, U.S."
  tagline: "Mapping and crowdsourcing the universe of public policy solutions."
  background: "New public policy is made every day by local, national and international government institutions. Although governments operate in different contexts across the world, they nonetheless face very similar governance challenges--for example, educating their populations or increasing their public’s safety. Due to this significant overlap in governmental missions, tremendous potential exists for societies to pool together their collective knowledge and learn from each other’s successes and failures."
  description:  "PolicyAtlas is a growing, non-­partisan project to develop a user-contributed encyclopedia of known public policy solutions (the “Atlas”). The Atlas will cover all major policy fields such as education, environmental, health, and transportation policy. For example, when a local government official seeks to reduce pedestrian deaths from automobile accidents, they can search the Atlas for policies that aim to achieve this goal and be presented with options such as traffic calming devices, pedestrian bridges and complete street designations. Dedicated articles cover each featured policy concept with a summary of its goals, implementation considerations, research studies, and supporters and opponents."
  impact: "Ultimately, the goal of PolicyAtlas is to improve the quality of public policymaking--and the lives of all who are governed--by providing more public policy options, informing better choices among public policies, and improving the design of policies in order to increase their likely political viability and effectiveness. PolicyAtlas is to become the most useful public policy resource in the world. Specific types of people who should find the Atlas useful include government officials, election candidates, journalists, advocates and researchers."

We’ll start by targeting small towns in concerted campaigns to create competition between companies. This way we’ll quickly reach tipping points where they begin to ‘race to the top’.

  background: "In our digital age the pressing question is no longer what information should be digitized, but rather how this process of digitalization should take place. Most public information is currently organized by procedure; publisher’s name, due date, etc. However, the content - affected areas or people, topics, participants and more - remain largely unstructured. As a result, despite growing computational power, machines remain surprisingly incapable of giving us an answer to the seemingly simple question; what is going on in my community?"
  description: "Commune offers municipal bodies a digital framework - ‘opn’ - to create, publish and archive public records as well structured open data, while simultaneously increasing their work efficiency and performance. "
  impact: "Municipality staffers will save time handling public information - local business and residents will gain better insight to government decision making processes and actions."

  tagline: "Bridging the Scientific Method with Projects in Civic Communities"
  background: "Civic Hacking is an agile approach that is focused more on solutions than taking a step away and think a lot. The scientific method is what has moved science so far to build robust explanations and solutions to so many different fields. How can we take the best of the two worlds and build robust explanations and solutions to so many different fields. How can we take the best of the worlds and build robust solutions while keeping a fast pace?"
  description: "We try to get the best of the scientific method by following a 5 point rulebook to our civic hacking projects, that come from the traditional academic research: (1) Clear problem definition (2) Definition of Roles (3) Mentoring (4) Follow Up (5) Publish and Share"
  impact: "Every project in our brigade needs to have great reach and impact. Taking into account past efforts, building bridges to experienced community and having a philosophy of sharing and publishing, will help build more solid projects."

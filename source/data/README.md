# Example data files

## YAML

**data.yaml** - example dataset that could be used to populate a repo of generated templates

**default.yaml** - this is an example default global dataset used for non-generated templates

## JSON

**NOTE: generally you shouldn't edit these json files manually, and instead edit the yaml which will be converted into json.** The main exception to this would be if json data was generated from another source, or created through a similarly automatic process.

**data.json** - this is where data for generated templates goes (converted from yaml)

**default.json** - this is a default global dataset used for everything else (converted from yaml)

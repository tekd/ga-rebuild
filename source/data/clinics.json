It examines the role citizen engagement can play in improving policymaking  and pubic service delivery, and investigates the impact of new technologies, particularly in developing countries. Participants can contribute their own\n insights and connect with others through online forums, dedicated social\n media channels, and Google hangouts.\n","description_long":null,"faculty_members":null,"actions":[{"label":"Course Website","link":"http://bit.ly/citizensengage"}],"certificates":{"blended":false,"online":false,"in_person":false,"for_credit":false,"for_certificate":false},"is_active":true,"is_crosslisted":true}]
